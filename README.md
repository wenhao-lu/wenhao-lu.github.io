# Portfolio Page

Welcome to my Portfolio! This is the deployed version of my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) for interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Powered by a [CMS](https://cms.lu-kevin.com/) developed with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and a RESTful API for seamless data management and integration.
- **Hosting**: Deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://wenhao-lu.github.io/) with data hosted on a secure remote server.
